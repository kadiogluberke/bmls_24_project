This repository originates from a project developed during the *Building ML Solutions* course at Harbour.Space University in August 2024. The original project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/building-ml-hs). This repository was created for personal exploration and experimentation.

Please also check my brilliant friend [Humberto Yusta GÃ³mez](https://github.com/humbertoyusta), who is also a contributor to the project.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive machine learning solution for a real-life business problem. Specifically, the goal is to create an automated ML pipeline to predict travel times for taxi rides.

### Key Features
- **Database:** Postgres is used as database.
- **Cloud Storage:** Amazon S3 is utilized for storing data and models.
- **Data and Model Tracking:** DVC (Data Version Control) is implemented for efficient tracking.
- **Deployment:** The project employs Fly.io for deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Grafana and Evidently are integrated for monitoring model performance and metrics.
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Prefect is set up for potential scheduled pipeline execution.
- **CI/CD:** Github Actions are used for automated deployment
